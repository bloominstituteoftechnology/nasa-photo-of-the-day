# NASA APOD Part II - Advanced Styling Techniques

In this project you will refactor the styling you completed in the APOD app. You will style it using [Styled Components](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/nasa-photo-of-the-day.git), although you are welcome to _also_ use one or two [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) components if you wish.

## Introduction

- [x] This will be a continuation of the project you've already started.
- [x] Our goal here is to apply advanced styling techniques in your React application.
- [x] You don't need to start from scratch. Use the work you did previously.
- [x] Let's say that the designs have changed. There are new ways and implementations of doing things as time goes by. As stated earlier, these are normal in the real world. It's time for us to dig into the code to make it better.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set Up

This homework is a continuation of the work you have done previously.

- [x] CD into your old project
- [x] Continue to make changes and push to the same branch

### Task 2a: MVP Requirements

- [ ] Style your app using styled-components.

### Task 3: Stretch Problems

Do not attempt stretch problems until MVP has been reached and a final commit has been made.

- [ ] Read the documentation for MaterialUI to use in place of Reactstrap or Emotion to use in place of styled-components and use either in your app.
- [ ] Try out tailwind css. It's a little tough to get it started in your app, but it's a great library that is gaining popularity very quickly. Here are the [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/), and here is an [article](https://medium.com/@pipecork/using-tailwind-in-react-quickstart-4b06c10317b5) to help you get it started in a React app (written by [Max David](https://medium.com/@pipecork), a Lambda student).
- [ ] Implement snapshot testing in your react application.

## Submission Format

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge Branch into `main` (student's Repository).
