# NASA APOD Part II - Advanced Styling Techniques

In this project you will refactor the styling you completed in the APOD app. You will style it using one of the styling libraries you learned in this module.

## Introduction

- [x] This will be a continuation of the project you've already started.
- [x] Our goal here is to apply advance styling techniques for your React application.
- [x] You don't need to start from scratch. Use the work you did previously.
- [x] Let's say that the designs have changed. There are new ways and implementations of doing things as time goes by. As stated earlier, these are normal in the real world. It's time for us to dig into the code to make it better.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set Up

This homework is a continuation of the work you have done previously.

- [x] CD into your old project
- [x] Continue to make changes and push to the same branch

### Task 2a: MVP Requirements

- [ ] Refactor your project using a component library that was covered in class (Reactstrap or styled-components).
- [ ] Implement and use at least a few styled components to beautify your project.

### Task 2b: Exit Ticket

Once you begin, you will have 15 minutes to answer the questions [here](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/J2kBzdr6YLLjXzP8N/7JLwsLBKeWdAFp).

The completion of these questions is mandatory for MVP. However, passing the quiz doesn't affect your standing as a Lambda School student whatsoever. This is Lambda School testing itself! Please answer honestly and to the best of your ability without using external references.

### Task 3: Stretch Problems

Do not attempt stretch problems until MVP has been reached and a final commit has been made.

- [ ] Read the documentation for MaterialUI to use in place of Reactstrap or Emotion to use in place of styled-components and use either in your app.
- [ ] Try out tailwind css. It's a little tough to get it started in your app, but it's a great library that is gaining popularity very quickly. Here are the [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/), and here is an [article](https://medium.com/@pipecork/using-tailwind-in-react-quickstart-4b06c10317b5) to help you get it started in a React app (written by [Max David](https://medium.com/@pipecork), a Lambda student).
- [ ] Implement snapshot testing in your react application.

## Submission Format

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge Branch into `main` (student's Repository).
- [ ] Add your team lead as a reviewer on the pull-request
- [ ] Your team lead will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into `main` branch.
- [ ] Do your magic!
