const dummy = {"date":"2021-02-03","explanation":"Was the oldest known rock on Earth found on the Moon? Quite possibly.  The story opens with the Apollo 14 lunar mission. Lunar sample 14321, a large rock found in Cone crater by astronaut Alan Shepard, when analyzed back on Earth, was found to have a fragment that was a much better match to Earth rocks than other Moon rocks.  Even more surprising, that rock section has recently been dated back 4 billion years, making it older, to within measurement uncertainty, than any rock ever found on Earth.  A leading hypothesis now holds that an ancient comet or asteroid impact launched Earth rocks into the Solar System, some of which fell back to the Moon, became mixed with heated lunar soil and other rocks, cooled, and re-fragmented.  The video features an internal X-ray scan of 14321 showing multiple sections with markedly different chemistries. Moon rocks will continue to be studied to learn a more complete history of the Moon, the Earth, and the early Solar System.  Friday marks the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 14 landing on the Moon.","media_type":"video","service_version":"v1","title":"Found on the Moon: Candidate for Oldest Known Earth Rock","url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V0UBZh6Hf-s?rel=0"}
