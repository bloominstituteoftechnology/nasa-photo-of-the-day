        "explanation": "This was not a typical sun pillar.  Just after sunrise two weeks ago in Providence, Rhode
     Island, USA, a photographer, looking out his window, was suddenly awestruck. The astonishment was caused by 
    a sun pillar that fanned out at the top.  Sun pillars, singular columns of light going up from the Sun, are t
    hemselves rare to see, and are known to be caused by sunlight reflecting from wobbling, hexagon-shaped ice-di
    sks falling through Earth's atmosphere.  Separately, upper tangent arcs are known to be caused by sunlight re
    fracting through falling hexagon-shaped ice-tubes. Finding a sun pillar connected to an upper tangent arc is 
    extraordinary, and, initially, took some analysis to figure out what was going on. A leading theory is that t
    his sun pillar was also created, in a complex and unusual way, by falling ice tubes.  Few might believe that 
    such a rare phenomenon was seen again if it wasn't for the quick thinking of the photographer -- and the came
    ra on his nearby smartphone.    News from Mars: NASA Perseverance Coverage",
